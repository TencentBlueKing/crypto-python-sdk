## Overview

Ô∏èüîß BlueKing crypto-python-sdk is a lightweight cryptography toolkit based on encryption libraries such as pyCryptodome
and tongsuopy, providing a unified encryption and decryption implementation for Python applications, facilitating
non-intrusive switching between different encryption methods in projects.

## Features

* [Basic] Provides a unified encryption abstraction layer, docks with Cryptodome / tongsuopy and other encryption
  libraries, and provides a unified encryption and decryption implementation.
* [Basic] Supports mainstream international cryptography algorithms: AES, RSA.
* [Basic] Supports Chinese commercial cryptography algorithms: SM2, SM4.
* [Basic] Asymmetric encryption supports CBC, CTR, GCM, CFB as block cipher modes.
* [Contrib] Django Support, integrated Django settings, ModelField.

## Getting started

### Installation

```bash
$ pip install bk-crypto-python-sdk
```

### Usage

> For more usage, please refer to: [Usage Documentation](docs/usage.md)

Configure in the project

```python
import os
from bkcrypto import constants
from bkcrypto.symmetric.options import AESSymmetricOptions, SM4SymmetricOptions

BKCRYPTO = {
    # Declare the asymmetric encryption algorithm used in the project
    "ASYMMETRIC_CIPHER_TYPE": constants.AsymmetricCipherType.SM2.value,
    # Declare the symmetric encryption algorithm used in the project
    "SYMMETRIC_CIPHER_TYPE": constants.SymmetricCipherType.SM4.value,
    "SYMMETRIC_CIPHERS": {
        # default - The configured symmetric encryption instance, multiple instances can be configured according to project needs
        "default": {
            # Optional, used when the key cannot be obtained directly in settings
            # "get_key_config": "apps.utils.encrypt.key.get_key_config",
            # Optional, used for ModelField, when encrypting, it carries this prefix into the database, when decrypting, it analyzes this prefix and selects the corresponding decryption algorithm
            # ‚ö†Ô∏è Prefix and cipher type must correspond one-to-one, and there can be no prefix matching relationship
            # "db_prefix_map": {
            #     SymmetricCipherType.AES.value: "aes_str:::",
            #     SymmetricCipherType.SM4.value: "sm4_str:::"
            # },
            "common": {"key": os.urandom(24)},
            "cipher_options": {
                constants.SymmetricCipherType.AES.value: AESSymmetricOptions(
                    key_size=24,
                    iv=os.urandom(16),
                    mode=constants.SymmetricMode.CFB,
                    encryption_metadata_combination_mode=constants.EncryptionMetadataCombinationMode.STRING_SEP
                ),
                constants.SymmetricCipherType.SM4.value: SM4SymmetricOptions(mode=constants.SymmetricMode.CTR)
            }
        },
    }
}
```

#### Asymmetric encryption

```python
from bkcrypto.asymmetric.ciphers import BaseAsymmetricCipher
from bkcrypto.contrib.django.ciphers import get_asymmetric_cipher

asymmetric_cipher: BaseAsymmetricCipher = get_asymmetric_cipher()

# Encrypt and decrypt
assert "123" == asymmetric_cipher.decrypt(asymmetric_cipher.encrypt("123"))
# Verify signature
assert asymmetric_cipher.verify(plaintext="123", signature=asymmetric_cipher.sign("123"))
```

#### Symmetric encryption

```python
from bkcrypto.symmetric.ciphers import BaseSymmetricCipher
from bkcrypto.contrib.django.ciphers import symmetric_cipher_manager

# using - Specifies the symmetric encryption instance, the default is `default`
symmetric_cipher: BaseSymmetricCipher = symmetric_cipher_manager.cipher(using="default")
assert "123" == symmetric_cipher.decrypt(symmetric_cipher.encrypt("123"))
```

#### SymmetricTextField

```python
from django.db import models
from bkcrypto.contrib.django.fields import SymmetricTextField


class IdentityData(models.Model):
    password = SymmetricTextField("Password", blank=True, null=True)
```
