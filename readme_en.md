## Overview

Ô∏èüîß BlueKing crypto-python-sdk is a lightweight cryptography toolkit based on encryption libraries such as pyCryptodome
and tongsuopy, providing a unified encryption and decryption implementation for Python applications, making it easy for
projects to switch between different encryption methods without intrusion.

## Features

* [Basic] Provides a unified encryption abstraction layer, docking with Cryptodome / tongsuopy and other encryption
  libraries, providing a unified encryption and decryption implementation
* [Basic] Supports mainstream international cryptography algorithms: AES, RSA
* [Basic] Supports Chinese commercial cryptography algorithms: SM2, SM4
* [Basic] Asymmetric encryption supports CBC, CTR, GCM, CFB as block cipher modes
* [Contrib] Django Support, integrating Django settings, ModelField

## Getting started

### Installation

```bash
$ pip install bk-crypto-python-sdk
```

### Usage

> For more usage guidelines, please refer
> to: [Usage Documentation](https://github.com/TencentBlueKing/crypto-python-sdk/blob/main/docs/usage.md)

#### 1. Basic Usage

**Asymmetric Encryption**

````python
from bkcrypto import constants
from bkcrypto.asymmetric import options
from bkcrypto.asymmetric.ciphers import BaseAsymmetricCipher
from bkcrypto.contrib.basic.ciphers import get_asymmetric_cipher

asymmetric_cipher: BaseAsymmetricCipher = get_asymmetric_cipher(
    cipher_type=constants.AsymmetricCipherType.SM2.value,
    # Passing in None will randomly generate a key, the business can choose to pass in a key or randomly generate it according to the scenario.
    cipher_options={
        constants.AsymmetricCipherType.SM2.value: options.SM2AsymmetricOptions(
            private_key_string=None
        ),
        constants.AsymmetricCipherType.RSA.value: options.SM2AsymmetricOptions(
            private_key_string=None
        ),
    }
)

# Encrypt and Decrypt
assert "123" == asymmetric_cipher.decrypt(asymmetric_cipher.encrypt("123"))
# Signature verification
assert asymmetric_cipher.verify(plaintext="123", signature=asymmetric_cipher.sign("123"))
````

**Symmetric Encryption**

```python
import os

from bkcrypto import constants
from bkcrypto.symmetric.ciphers import BaseSymmetricCipher
from bkcrypto.contrib.basic.ciphers import get_symmetric_cipher

symmetric_cipher: BaseSymmetricCipher = get_symmetric_cipher(
    cipher_type=constants.SymmetricCipherType.SM4.value,
    common={"key": os.urandom(16)},
)
assert "123" == symmetric_cipher.decrypt(symmetric_cipher.encrypt("123"))
```

#### 2. Using with Django

Configure the encryption algorithm type in Django Settings

```python
from bkcrypto import constants

BKCRYPTO = {
    # Declare the asymmetric encryption algorithm used by the project
    "ASYMMETRIC_CIPHER_TYPE": constants.AsymmetricCipherType.SM2.value,
    # Declare the symmetric encryption algorithm used by the project
    "SYMMETRIC_CIPHER_TYPE": constants.SymmetricCipherType.SM4.value,
}
```

**Asymmetric Encryption**

```python
from bkcrypto.asymmetric.ciphers import BaseAsymmetricCipher
from bkcrypto.contrib.django.ciphers import get_asymmetric_cipher

asymmetric_cipher: BaseAsymmetricCipher = get_asymmetric_cipher()

# Encrypt and Decrypt
assert "123" == asymmetric_cipher.decrypt(asymmetric_cipher.encrypt("123"))
# Signature verification
assert asymmetric_cipher.verify(plaintext="123", signature=asymmetric_cipher.sign("123"))
```

**Symmetric Encryption**

```python
from bkcrypto.symmetric.ciphers import BaseSymmetricCipher
from bkcrypto.contrib.django.ciphers import get_symmetric_cipher

symmetric_cipher: BaseSymmetricCipher = get_symmetric_cipher()
assert "123" == symmetric_cipher.decrypt(symmetric_cipher.encrypt("123"))
```

#### 3. Using Django CipherManager

Configure the encryption algorithm type in Django Settings

```python
from bkcrypto import constants
from bkcrypto.symmetric.options import AESSymmetricOptions, SM4SymmetricOptions
from bkcrypto.asymmetric.options import RSAAsymmetricOptions, SM2AsymmetricOptions

BKCRYPTO = {
    # Declare the asymmetric encryption algorithm used by the project
    "ASYMMETRIC_CIPHER_TYPE": constants.AsymmetricCipherType.SM2.value,
    # Declare the symmetric encryption algorithm used by the project
    "SYMMETRIC_CIPHER_TYPE": constants.SymmetricCipherType.SM4.value,
    "SYMMETRIC_CIPHERS": {
        # default - The configured symmetric encryption instance can be configured with multiple instances depending on the project requirements
        "default": {
            # Optional, used in cases where settings cannot directly obtain the key
            # "get_key_config": "apps.utils.encrypt.key.get_key_config",
            # Optional, used for ModelField, encrypted with this prefix to store the database, decrypting and analyzing the prefix and selecting the appropriate decryption algorithm
            # ‚ö†Ô∏è The prefix and cipher type must be in one-to-one correspondence, and there can be no prefix matching relationship
            # "db_prefix_map": {
            #     SymmetricCipherType.AES.value: "aes_str:::",
            #     SymmetricCipherType.SM4.value: "sm4_str:::"
            # },
            # Common parameter configuration, sharing these parameters when initializing different ciphers
            "common": {"key": "your key"},
            "cipher_options": {
                constants.SymmetricCipherType.AES.value: AESSymmetricOptions(key_size=16),
                # Blue Whale recommended configuration
                constants.SymmetricCipherType.SM4.value: SM4SymmetricOptions(mode=constants.SymmetricMode.CTR)
            }
        },
    },
    "ASYMMETRIC_CIPHERS": {
        # Configuration same as SYMMETRIC_CIPHERS
        "default": {
            "common": {"public_key_string": "your key"},
            "cipher_options": {
                constants.AsymmetricCipherType.RSA.value: RSAAsymmetricOptions(
                    padding=constants.RSACipherPadding.PKCS1_OAEP
                ),
                constants.AsymmetricCipherType.SM2.value: SM2AsymmetricOptions()
            },
        },
    }
}
```

**Asymmetric Encryption**

Use `asymmetric_cipher_manager` to get the `cipher` configured for `BKCRYPTO.ASYMMETRIC_CIPHERS`

```python
from bkcrypto.asymmetric.ciphers import BaseAsymmetricCipher
from bkcrypto.contrib.django.ciphers import asymmetric_cipher_manager

asymmetric_cipher: BaseAsymmetricCipher = asymmetric_cipher_manager.cipher(using="default")

# Encrypt and Decrypt
assert "123" == asymmetric_cipher.decrypt(asymmetric_cipher.encrypt("123"))
# Signature verification
assert asymmetric_cipher.verify(plaintext="123", signature=asymmetric_cipher.sign("123"))
```

**Symmetric Encryption**

Use `symmetric_cipher_manager` to get the `cipher` configured for `BKCRYPTO.SYMMETRIC_CIPHERS`

```python
from bkcrypto.symmetric.ciphers import BaseSymmetricCipher
from bkcrypto.contrib.django.ciphers import symmetric_cipher_manager

# using - Specifies a symmetric encryption instance, defaults to 'default'
symmetric_cipher: BaseSymmetricCipher = symmetric_cipher_manager.cipher(using="default")
assert "123" == symmetric_cipher.decrypt(symmetric_cipher.encrypt("123"))
```

**Django ModelField**

```python
from django.db import models
from bkcrypto.contrib.django.fields import SymmetricTextField


class IdentityData(models.Model):
    password = SymmetricTextField("Password", blank=True, null=True)
```
